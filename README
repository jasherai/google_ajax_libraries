Google Ajax Libraries
=====================

From http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlibs/documentation/

"The AJAX Libraries API is a content distribution network and loading 
architecture for the most popular open source JavaScript libraries. 
By using the Google AJAX API Loader's google.load() method, your 
application has high speed, globaly available access to a growing list 
of the most popular JavaScript open source libraries including:

* jQuery
* prototype
* script.aculo.us
* MooTools
* dojo

"The AJAX Libraries API takes the pain out of developing mashups in 
JavaScript while using a collection of libraries. We take the pain 
out of hosting the libraries, correctly setting cache headers, staying 
up to date with the most recent bug fixes, etc."

Example
=======

  <%= google_javascript_include_tag :prototype, :scriptaculous %>
  <%= google_javascript_include_tag [:prototype, "1.2.6"], :scriptaculous %>
